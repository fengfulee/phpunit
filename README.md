phpunit
=======

PHPunit is a good stuff !

Well, I want to have a deep understanding of PHP.
How can I improve ?
I forget the usage of a lot of functions which lead  to the second-time learning.
Recently, I found phpunit. It is a good stuff. 
I can easily test my own code without the environment and mess output.
